# KFC-Hackton

Hackton Project during last week of the Code For All_ Bootcamp about Olympic Games and Reach music By Gloria Estefan.

24 hours to develop this with an awesome team with crazy ideas.

We initially did mini Scrum sessions with 1-hour sprints, which we later extended to 2-hour sprints. We started off programming individually, but eventually stated to pair programming.

So this website basicly fetches in our database a few players from the Olympic of 1996 and you can bet in one of them, In Athletics or Swimming and we have a credit system that if you win, you double and if you lose, well, you lose.
